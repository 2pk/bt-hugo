_(This is the last of this HTPC build series do read the <a href="http://pnarula.com/2012/htpc-1/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnarula.com/2012/htpc-1/', 'Part 1 &#8211; HTPC Research']);" >Part 1 &#8211; HTPC Research</a> and <a href="http://pnarula.com/2012/htpc-2/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnarula.com/2012/htpc-2/', 'Part 2 &#8211; HTPC Build ']);" >Part 2 &#8211; HTPC Build </a>)_

After researching for almost 3 years HTPC was finally built and is the center of my audio video setup. It is truly a one-box-to-rule-the-all solution. I was able to replace the following AV components with this single box

  1. Google TV &#8211; online streaming
  2. WDTV Live &#8211; local media player
  3. Comcast Cable Settop box
  4. Bluray-DVD player
  5. Digital Video Recorder

Here is a photo I posted on facebook

My AV Setup now includes &#8211; HTPC, audio receiver, RF based keyboard and remote, Harmony remote. HTPC provides the following capabilities

  * Live cable TV
  * DVR
  * Netflix, Hulu etc
  * Desi movie watching from bwcinema.com
  * Online music &#8211; pandora, saavn, dhingana
  * Local media play i.e. digital photos, home videos
  * Bluray/DVD player
  * File and backup server

Let us see how long this setup would last <img src="http://pnarula.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
