Here is a clue to Intel/AMD &#8211; with HD camcorders becoming a commodity a lot more consumers will be mucking around with HD movies at home. Just the playback of HD quality (1080p) movies in AVCHD format is a heart churning exercise for computer processors. I run some pretty heavy enterprise server applications on my computer and my computer has been chugging along faithfully. But today when I tried to playback a AVCHD movie using <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirillis.com%2Foxygenplayer.html&ei=jXpJSJiRK5yIgAK5yKDTAw&usg=AFQjCNE5TRfLrQixpK36fPH9aSGKSsnxfA&sig2=rxD-xd0Zmy2BtC5efFF27A" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=4&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirillis.com%2Foxygenplayer.html&ei=jXpJSJiRK5yIgAK5yKDTAw&usg=AFQjCNE5TRfLrQixpK36fPH9aSGKSsnxfA&sig2=rxD-xd0Zmy2BtC5efFF27A', 'Oxygen']);" >Oxygen</a> and shooted using the brand new Canon HF 100, my computer showed signs of age. My immediate reaction was to get a computer with more fire under its belly.

So a little nudge from the microprocessor makers would go a long way for consumers to upgrade their computers.

BTW if you are in the market for a HD camcorder and looking for resources to research &#8211; <a href="http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/forumdisplay.php?f=161" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/forumdisplay.php?f=161', 'Camcorder forum']);" >Camcorder forum</a> at AVS Forums is a great resource. There is even a blog for the <a href="http://canon-hf100.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://canon-hf100.blogspot.com/', 'Canon model']);" >Canon model</a> I bought. Looking for samples of HD video online &#8211; <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/tag:hf100" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vimeo.com/tag:hf100', 'vimeo']);" >vimeo</a> is your friend. It is the videos like this that made me buy the camcorder. When playing the video don&#8217;t forget to switch the HD mode on.
