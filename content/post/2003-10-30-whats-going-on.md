I have been working in the Enterprise Portals space for more than 2 years. Quite a few portal companies have also been able to survive the ongoing recession in Tech sector. But for the first time in these years I have worked in portals I am seeing some frentic activity. People are getting offers at dot-com era salaries. So life has become suddenly charming. Apart from all this I am still learning web-dynpro and related techonologies in NetWeaver Developer Studio in whatever free time I am getting.
