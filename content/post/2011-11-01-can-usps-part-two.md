I recently wrote about if <a href="http://pnarula.com/2011/can-usps-survive-as-webvan/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnarula.com/2011/can-usps-survive-as-webvan/', 'USPS can survive as webvan']);" >USPS can survive as webvan</a>, on a similar note it was refreshing to see this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/world/europe/deutsche-post-reinvents-services-in-a-digital-world.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/world/europe/deutsche-post-reinvents-services-in-a-digital-world.html', 'NYT story']);" >NYT story</a> about Deutsche Post and how it is thriving and evolving for digital age

And the facility housing it is not a post office at all. Deutsche Post occupies a corner space in a bank.

What was news to me was how USPS is constrained by law not to evolve or play in limited markets

> It’s easy to say that the U.S.P.S. is a bunch of morons, but they live under legislative restrictions on what businesses they can enter and are expressly prevented from entering business unless it’s related to physical mail.

Now thats a bummer. I wonder if these legislative restrictions would be relaxed as things get more digital.
