Back in <a href="http://www.pec.ac.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pec.ac.in', 'college']);" >college</a> as a student of electrical engineering _Wireless Power_ used to be the holy grail for us. And now as a consultant with my notebook with me every where I go, there can be nothing better than this. This concern is shared by so many. Came across this <a href="http://www.thefeature.com/user/paulbhartzog/journalentry?id=1020" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thefeature.com/user/paulbhartzog/journalentry?id=1020', 'great article']);" >great article</a> by Paul Hartzog on wireless power via <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2004/10/wireless_power_.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2004/10/wireless_power_.html', 'A VC']);" >A VC</a>. Do read it, nice history and where we are with wireless power.
