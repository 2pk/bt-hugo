What a delightful book to read about business of software as a product and services. After starting as a developer I have been in the services for the past few years. Michael Cusumano, the author distills the business of software in few succinct words

&nbsp;

> The Software services business &#8230; is about getting enough profitable accounts to keep your consultants and developers busy close to 100 percent of the time&#8230;..
> 
> It is usually important to mix senior people with junior to maximize profits for any given client project&#8230;&#8230;
> 
> economies of scope are the holy grail&#8230;.. they can come from structuring knowledge such as how to do requirements, manage projects, customize applications, conduct user acceptance testing, or reuse design frameworks and even pieces of code across different projects and customers.

Do read this book if you are starting a career in software in whatever side of the business &#8211; product or services.
