When Dash Express, a GPS with internet connectivity and utilizing the collective knowledge about routes from its users was announced, it was quite an innovative concept. But it seems ants might have beaten them to it. Though a bit of rudimentary technology but it works from the Telegraph article (HT <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/11/assorted-link-1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/11/assorted-link-1.html', 'Marginal Revolution']);"  target="_blank">Marginal Revolution</a>)

It is a pity that Dash is <a href="http://blog.dash.net/2008/11/03/a-new-direction/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blog.dash.net/2008/11/03/a-new-direction/', 'getting out']);"  target="_blank">getting out</a> of <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/11/03/dash-charts-a-new-course-cutting-50-jobs/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gigaom.com/2008/11/03/dash-charts-a-new-course-cutting-50-jobs/', 'making their own hardware']);"  target="_blank">making their own hardware</a>. I am sure they will survive and hope to use their technology someday in some form.
