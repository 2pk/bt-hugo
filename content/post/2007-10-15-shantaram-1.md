After many many years I have started reading a novel based on the true story of author &#8211; Shantaram. I am on the 11th page and I love it. Here is a blurb about Bombay

> A bullock cart was drawn up beside a modern sports car at a traffic signal. A man squatted to relieve himself behind the discreet shelter of a satellite dish. An electric forklift truck was being used to unload goods from an ancient wooden cart with wooden wheels. The impression was of a ploding, indefatigable, and distant past that had crashed intact through barriers of time, into its own future.

A little be dramatic but about right for any large city in India.
