<img width="150" height="50" align="right" alt="One cold day in MKE" title="One cold day in MKE" src="http://pnarula.com/images/bt/cold-mke.jpg" />This is the first time I am in this cold a weather. Check the photo I took of the compass in the rental **9 degrees fahrenheit.** Last time I was in this cold would have been in Louisville about 14 degrees.
