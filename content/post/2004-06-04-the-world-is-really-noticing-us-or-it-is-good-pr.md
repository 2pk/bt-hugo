Stories like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/04/business/worldbusiness/04reliance.html?ex=1087012800&#038;en=02a2340e5b00e844&#038;ei=5062&#038;partner=GOOGLE" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/04/business/worldbusiness/04reliance.html?ex=1087012800&#038;en=02a2340e5b00e844&#038;ei=5062&#038;partner=GOOGLE', 'A Giant So Big It&#8217;s a Proxy for India&#8217;s Economy']);" >A Giant So Big It&#8217;s a Proxy for India&#8217;s Economy</a> always make me prowd, but then somewhere in the back a thought lurks is it a result of good PR. But anyway this story reminds me of an advice CNET radio anchor for a investment talk show use to give &#8211; &#8220;Tech stocks are not the real index of economy, shares like Home Depot, Wal-Mart really tell you where the economy is going&#8221;

Quote from the article on Reliance at NY Times

> In the tumult of putting a new government in place in India, the stock of Reliance Industries was a good gauge of expectations about the prospects for continued economic liberalization. 

Another question that comes to mind is while it is good but just like in cricket we need more good players besides Sachin.
