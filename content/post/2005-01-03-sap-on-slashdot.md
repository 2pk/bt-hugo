If something makes a news on Slashdot it has to belong to the kingdom of day-to-day geeks. Typically SAP professionals start getting the news about cool technologies brewing inside the tech giant thru various niche magazines and lately <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.sdn.sap.com', 'SDN']);" >SDN</a>. I was excited to read <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/u/9217" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/u/9217', 'Dagfinn Parnas']);" >Dagfinn Parnas</a>&#8216;s article <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/wlg/940" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.sdn.sap.com/sdn/weblogs.sdn?blog=/pub/wlg/940', 'SAP Virtual Machine Container (as seen on TechEd)']);" >SAP Virtual Machine Container (as seen on TechEd)</a>. But <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/03/1434213" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/01/03/1434213', 'this article']);" >this article</a> on slashdot just makes my day&#8230;

> Writing an article about &#8220;<a href="http://www.javadevelopersjournal.com/story/?storyid=47362&#038;de=1" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.javadevelopersjournal.com/story/?storyid=47362&#038;de=1', 'A Java Server That Never Goes Down']);" >A Java Server That Never Goes Down</a>&#8221; is pure hubris, but a German developer who says he&#8217;s been &#8220;eating, sleeping, and drinking Java&#8221; for 8 years doesn&#8217;t seem to care and his article brings to light the aspects of VM we rarely think of as he introduces &#8220;user isolation&#8221; and tells about some interesting work SAP in Germany is doing in that area, merging the Java and the ABAP worlds.&#8221;
