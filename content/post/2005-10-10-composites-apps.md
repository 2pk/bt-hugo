My own take on the software evolution can be summarized in very few words &#8211;
  


> First there were custom apps,     
> Then came COTS<sup>[1]</sup>    
> Now is the age of the composite applications

What is more motivating in the story is validation of SAP&#8217;s Netweaver Intiative. Being a Netweaver professional it makes me smile. Quoting Sadgopan

> SAP is said to be devoting as much as a third of its overall R&D efforts towards building composites & its roadmap promises to provide its customers with the ability to create new business processes on the fly & avoid any rebuilds
