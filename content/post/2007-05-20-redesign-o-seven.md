Finished another redesign of Beta Thoughts. It is hard to understand why I redesign. This redesign is probably the best I have seen on this semi-active blog. Here is how I did it

  1. I have used the <a href="http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2007/03/23/widget-ready-blogging-pro-theme/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2007/03/23/widget-ready-blogging-pro-theme/', 'BloggingPro Widgets Ready']);" >BloggingPro Widgets Ready</a> theme from Blogging Pro.
  2. Choice of colors comes from the latest book by <a href="http://www.dealingwithdarwin.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dealingwithdarwin.com/', 'Geoffery Moore &#8211; Dealing with Darwin']);" >Geoffery Moore &#8211; Dealing with Darwin</a>. I am quite pleased with how it has turned up.
  3. Beta Thoughts logo at the top is created by using the excellent font Delicious found <a href="http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html', 'here.']);" >here.</a>
  4. Changed the image on About page. Now it shows a photograph clicked while on our way back from Santa Barbara going towards Solvang.<!--more-->

  5. Used the <a href="https://weblogs.sdn.sap.com/pub/u/3477" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://weblogs.sdn.sap.com/pub/u/3477', 'SDN']);" >SDN</a> profile image on the front page profile and also provided the link to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/pankajkumar" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.linkedin.com/in/pankajkumar', 'my profile']);" >my profile</a> on LinkedIn.
  6. Switched the tag line from &#8220;My tech life &#8211; Enjoying every moment of IT&#8221; to &#8220;Intense Activity &#8211; in the midst of eternal calmness&#8221;. This one comes originally from Bhagwad Gita but was reiterated beautifully by Swami Vivekanand in his lecture series <a href="http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_2/practical_vedanta_and_other_lectures/practical_vedanta_part_i.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_2/practical_vedanta_and_other_lectures/practical_vedanta_part_i.htm', 'Practical Vedanta']);" >Practical Vedanta</a>.
  7. Few things are still left to be done like comment form colors, round edges etc.
  8. Apart from this I used Notepad, FileZilla, Powerpoint, Paint.Net and MS Paint.

If you happen to notice this change, do let me know how you like it.
