Over the years I have grown fond of economics. I stumbled across Brad deLong&#8217;s blog and started reading some stuff about economics. Then I read <a title="The Great Unravling by Paul Krugman" href="http://http//pnarula.com/200410/the-great-unraveling-by-paul-krugman/" target="_blank">&#8220;The Great Unraveling&#8221;</a> and it was a pleasure to read the ways Dr. Krugman explained some of the concepts using simple models. For the last few months I have been reading <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/', 'his blog']);"  target="_blank">his blog</a> at NYTimes and it has been very very informative. So when I read on <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/paul-krugman-wi.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/paul-krugman-wi.html', 'Marginal Revolution']);"  target="_blank">Marginal Revolution</a> this morning that Dr. Krugman has won this year&#8217;s Noble&#8217;s prize for economics, I said WOW..

Many many congrats to Dr. Krugman on the much deserved prize.
