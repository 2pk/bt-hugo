I have been living in the <a href="http://bayarea.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bayarea.com', ' bay area']);" >bay area</a> for the past five years. I must have moved into quite a few apartments. Every time I start hunting for a new apartment I use different websites for finding an apartment. One of the website I often use to find ratings of an apartment community is <a href="http://aptratings.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://aptratings.com', 'aptratings.com']);" >aptratings.com</a>. Finding an objective review from reviewers is a very tough task. Most of the time you would find that people don&#8217;t like any things. Management sucks at each and every community. Then there is the problem of management folks at these apartment communities posing as reviewers and writing positive reviews. Still there are few things one can keep in mind to gather some intelligence about the future home

1. Look for reviewers talking about noise problems from nearby highways. Then try to avoid those units.
  
2. Parking problems. Guest parking etc.
  
3. Cable/DSL/TV issues
