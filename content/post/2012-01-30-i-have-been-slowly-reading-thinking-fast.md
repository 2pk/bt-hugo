I have been slowly reading ”Thinking fast and slow” by Daniel Kahneman. It is full of fun phrases like ” nonregressive assessment of weak evidence” still it is an important book in understanding of human biases and how we decide what we decide. I am sure toread it multiple times. One really good thing is you can pick any chapter and read it a they are independent.
