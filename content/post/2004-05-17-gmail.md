Looks like I am getting addicted to Gmail as the days pass. Conversations concept is pretty nice, wish it was in Thunderbird or Outlook. No one can beat the search ability. I am at a point where I am redirecting more email at the google acct than pnarula dot com for which I pay. What world we are living in. I like a free service better than the one I pay for ðŸ˜€

There is one feature which I would like to see in email clients, ability to attach an annotation with an email so that instead of instead of subject this annotation shows. I saw this mentioned with something from IBM or somebody. This would be a killer as it would allow me to attach more meta info with an email.
