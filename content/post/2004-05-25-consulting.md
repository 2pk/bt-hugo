I have been a consultant for many years now. It has taken me to many new places, to many clients almost across complete US. While on the road experiences are bound to happen. Some good and some not so good. I always wanted to write them but never had the put them somewhere in a structured manner. Now with the medium of weblogs, I have got just what I was looking for. Here I would try to put my unstructured train of thoughts on consulting. Here is the first post in the consulting category.
