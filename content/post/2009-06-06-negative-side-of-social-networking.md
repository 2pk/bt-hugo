The world of social networking is catching very fast with the real world. Having water cooler talk is pretty normal but hear this now. I was getting ready for a welcome party for a baby and like any self respecting geek I asked Ms Beta Thoughts &#8211; hey I like this white shirt what do you think? Umm&#8230; didn&#8217;t you wear this when we went to Santa Cruz boardwalk, and we uploaded the photos so every one has seen this. Wear a different one.. Oh nooo&#8230;
