Happy Diwali&#8230; Today is the festival of lights for Indians. It also brings back the thought that has always plagued me on every Diwali -I have been in US. Quite a fews times people ask me what do you miss the most working US; while having been brought up in India. My answer has always been &#8211; festivals. Come to think of it why do we have festivals. IMO besides their own respective importance festivals break the monotony of life. They remind us that there is more to life than work ðŸ˜€ So I do try to do &#8211; as I would have done in India. But then that is no match at all. Even if I was able to fire crackers, buy a whole lot sweets, do all the praying to Goddess Lakshmi and God Ganesha as I have seen in my parents home; from where would I bring the aura that is there in every indian city and town around Diwali.

But then it is my choice to be here so friends whereever you are &#8220;Shubh Dipawali&#8221;
