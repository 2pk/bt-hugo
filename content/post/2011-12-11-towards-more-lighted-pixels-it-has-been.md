Towards more lighted pixels

It has been more than three years that I have had a DSLR(T1i) My usage has been mostly family outings with friends and family. But only after these years of use I have come to terms with most of the controls in the camera except for flash. Last night we were at global wonder winterland (<a href="http://www.globalwonderland.org/2011/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.globalwonderland.org/2011/', 'http://www.globalwonderland.org/2011/']);" >http://www.globalwonderland.org/2011/</a>) where I didn't have to think about setting to change and it came naturally. Still there was one instance where I was in hurry and I used the short cut to Auto  <img src="http://pnarula.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Another interesting thing that I have been noticing is the trend of everyone moving to DSLRs. At the global wonder winterland one could see more DSLRs and less P&Ses Ofcourse there were our iPhone photographers too.
