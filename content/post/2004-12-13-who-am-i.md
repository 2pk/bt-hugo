I came across this introduction about one self on <a href="http://weblog.neeraj.name/blog/_WebPages/aboutme.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://weblog.neeraj.name/blog/_WebPages/aboutme.html', 'Neeraj&#8217;s weblog']);" >Neeraj&#8217;s weblog</a>. Very nicely written and can be substituted for most of us

> **Who am I?**
> 
> I&#8217;m an alien and I&#8217;m not kidding. That&#8217;s how I was referred to by the paper handed over to me by the smiling immigration lady at the airport.
> 
> The emails I receive at work refer to me as a contractor to emphasize that only employees are invited to certain special parties.
> 
> I am referred to as a developer in my boss&#8217;s project plan.
> 
> My fellow countrymen (&women) call me a desi.
