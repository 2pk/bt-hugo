It is interesting to see the new architecture of wordpress. WordPress.com and self-hosted wordpress is all REST enabled now. There is a new desktop client. You can even manage your self hosted blogs from wordpress.com. They even use the new js flavor of the times &#8211; react ( I love react as well). From techie perspective it is quite nice.

What I would hate to see is that now that I am lured into logging into wordpress.com As a self-hosted blog for 10-11 years I have never had the need to login to wordpress.com. So now all self-hosted blogs dial home. This is quite good from commercial perspectives wherein Automattic would get the chance to see and maybe interact in auto-matt-ic way. If that happens I hope it would be quite non-intrusive.

Ok that was a good test post from the new wordpress.com mac client.
