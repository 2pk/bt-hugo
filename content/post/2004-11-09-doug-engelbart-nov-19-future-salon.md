Finally the stars have aligned, I have got a local project, Future Salon is happening on a favorable day. Now I will be able to attend one of the <a href="http://futuresalon.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://futuresalon.org', 'Future Salon']);" >Future Salon</a>s organized by Mark Finnern. What better way to start then attending the one by Doug Engelbart. The event is on Nov 19 in Palo Alto. More details <a href="http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/11/future_salon_do.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.futuresalon.org/2004/11/future_salon_do.html', 'here']);" >here</a>.

I am quite excited to attend this. I have read so much about Doug Engelbart. First I time I read about him was in a book name virtual communities or something like that or may be it was the graphics book in first year CS. Will be fun to attend.
