I am sure more than 50% folks were returning from Mandalay Bay. It was easily the biggest TechED so far with 6000 folks from all over the US, quite a few from outside US too. Attending the sessions you like and managing the schedule can be a lot of work &#8211; see right.

eSOA was the biggest theme this year and it was quite fun to participate in the Product Strategy workshops with Product Management folks. There were also quite a few sessions on Composition Environment. In fact Vishal Sikka&#8217;s keynote demoed some parts of the CE. Some of the other interesting things

It is a software appliance to speed up the delivery of NetWeaver Applications over the long haul WANs like between continents and long distances. It is achieved by caching and bandwidth shaping etc. 

**&#8220;New&#8221; Identity Management** &#8211; is based on SAP&#8217;s new acquisition Maxware. This will be very useful and powerful tool in SAP&#8217;s portfolio. I can see this tool filling a lot of gaps I have seen on NetWeaver implementations. Virtual Directory Server (VDS) concept inside this tool is quite powerful. VDS can put a facade around most of the user stores like LDAP, DB, ABAP user stores. Right now this exists as a separate tool from NetWeaver. Hopefully SAP would be integrating this with NW pretty soon.&nbsp; 

**Virtualization** &#8211; is a recurrent theme which has been very hot in the last few years. VMWare and Intel were seen promoting this heavily and I attended a session on virtualization and Linux

**SDN Clubhouse** &#8211; Not a technical thing but IMO clubhouse was the most fun place to be between the sessions. Cappuccinos and Mochas were excellent. Met a lot of interesting folks over here. Good to see <a href="http://craig.cmehil.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://craig.cmehil.com/', 'Craig Cmehil']);" >Craig Cmehil</a>, <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/weblogs?blog=/pub/u/8366" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/weblogs?blog=/pub/u/8366', 'Mario Herger']);" >Mario Herger</a>, Irfan Khan and Kartik Iyengar. There were a lot of activities going on like SAP demos on the pods, community theater, 5 partner stalls with lots of ipod touches to give :), check your basis skills in the back etc.

Overall a fun and tiring TechEd. You can see a large collection of photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/sapteched/pool/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.flickr.com/groups/sapteched/pool/', 'on Flickr']);" >on Flickr</a>. On Monday the first day I picked a lot of ribbons I associate with. Sticking them together and hanging under the badge would have made a nice necktie. But I chose to wear just the badge. Anyway here are the ribbons stuck together
