Trouble with bright kids 

There is very good discussion going at Hacker News (<a href="http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=3284169" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=3284169', 'http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=3284169']);" >http://news.ycombinator.org/item?id=3284169</a>) on an HBR blogs article. TL;DR version is that bright kids get praised for smartness plus our education system works for the lowest common denominator which means less challenges for the bright ones. These two things work against the bright kids.
