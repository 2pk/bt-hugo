MoveableType has <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sixapart.com/corner/archives/2004/05/its_about_time.shtml', 'moved']);" >moved</a> and after the <a href="http://pnarula.com/blog/archives/2004/05/09/beta-teasing/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnarula.com/blog/archives/2004/05/09/beta-teasing/', 'Beta-Tease']);" >Beta-Tease</a> phase have come up with new licensing terms to generate more revenues.
