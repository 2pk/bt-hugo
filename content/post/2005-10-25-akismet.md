So finally we know what Matt <a href="http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/10/25/announcing-akismet/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/10/25/announcing-akismet/', 'has been up to']);" >has been up to</a>. Just installed <a href="http://akismet.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://akismet.com', 'Akismet']);" >Akismet</a> on Beta Thoughts. I have deactivated Spam Karma for now. Let us see how effective Akismet is. One thing I fail to understand is the distribution mechanism of API keys. Does that mean that every one should have a weblog on wordpress.com as well as one&#8217;s personal weblog?? Hopefully the doubt will be clear in few days.

The name Akismet is interesting as kismet is urdu/persian word for fate. Â
