I have been reading <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/', 'Brad DeLong']);" >Brad DeLong</a>&#8216;s writings for quite sometime. I first came across him for one his book <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/Slouch_title.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/TCEH/Slouch_title.html', '&#8220;Slouching towards Utopia&#8221;']);" >&#8220;Slouching towards Utopia&#8221;</a>. This book made me feel good as it described the life of a worker during Victorian ages and present workers. Brad is a Professor of Economic at UCB and it is good to see how closely he is following IT to India phenomenon. Today on his blog he <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000811.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004_archives/000811.html', 'pointed']);" >pointed</a> to a story on Hindu about &#8220;Google opening office in India&#8221;.
