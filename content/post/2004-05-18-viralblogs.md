Once in a while, I go through the access and referrer log files for my domain i.e. pnarula.com. For the past few weeks I have been seeing a <a href="http://www.molly.com/mt/archives/000156.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.molly.com/mt/archives/000156.php', 'particular entry ']);" >particular entry </a>about her playing with WordPress. What is interesting is that she said

Localization link in Molly&#8217;s quote points to a test blog I have setup for hindi and I <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/3/5417" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/support/3/5417', 'announced']);" >announced</a> it on WP forums. I might have taken this site down without even knowing people might be coming to this. So I guess from now onwards I gotta be careful in creating these URLs.
