Om Malik of <a href="http://gigaom.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gigaom.com', 'GigaOm']);" >GigaOm</a> fame often <a href="http://pnarula.com/archives/2004/10/27/dont-you-love-om/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnarula.com/archives/2004/10/27/dont-you-love-om/', 'says']);" >says</a> _&#8220;Silicon Valley is a hot house where everyone smokes the same crappy weed and participates in a constant feedback loop.&#8221;_ Now we know on the internet everyone goes to their favorite hot houses i.e read their favorite bloggers. Indibloggies is a way to bring best of the weed from different spheres. So here are my nominations for my best weed err&#8230; nominations for Indibloggies

**IndiBlog of the year** &#8211; <a href="http://tunamihelp.blogspot.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://tunamihelp.blogspot.com', 'http://tsunamihelp.blogspot.com']);" >http://tsunamihelp.blogspot.com</a>

This has to go to the tsunamihelp. It mobilized the various people around the world and provided a single point of information for the Tsunami relief. A great example of power of blog medium.

**Best Technology IndiBlog** &#8211; <a href="http://123suds.blogspot.com/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://123suds.blogspot.com/', 'http://123suds.blogspot.com/']);" >http://123suds.blogspot.com/</a>

<strike>Prof</strike> SadagopanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weblog is an excellent commentary on various Emerging Technologies, Thoughts, Ideas, Trends and Cyber world. Very well written and shows the thought process from a deep experience. Although <strike>Prof </strike> he could use a little bigger font on his blog ðŸ˜€

Another technology blog I would like to nominate is <a href="http://gigaom.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://gigaom.com', 'Gigaom']);" >Gigaom</a> by Om Malik. He has the uncanny ability to review and analyze various things happening in tech world. When world was singing praises of Gmail he raised the flag of disenchantment.

And the last tech blog which I would like to nominate is <a href="http://news.techwhack.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://news.techwhack.com', 'TechWhack']);" >TechWhack</a> by <a href="http://sushubh.net" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sushubh.net', 'Sushubh']);" >Sushubh</a>. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take his younger age for his naivetÃƒÂ© in tech areas. If you subscribe to google news you would often find his posts on the front page in TechSection.

**Best Humanities(Art, Society, Politicsetc) IndiBlog** &#8211; <a href="http://www.dristikona.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dristikona.com', 'http://www.drishtikona.com']);" >http://www.drishtikona.com</a>

Dristikona Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a blog from a well experienced person Indra Sharma ji talks about Indian society and the challenges it faces. He never says a thing in vain and always proposes a solution to these hurdles. We all can learn a lot from his lifelong experiences and thoughts based on these which he shares through his blog. Hope more folks like him will join the bloggerdom.

**IndiBlog lifetime achiever** &#8211; <a href="http://opinion.paifamily.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://opinion.paifamily.com', 'http://opinion.paifamily.com']);" >http://opinion.paifamily.com</a>

Nitin PaiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Acorn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a day is never complete without reading the opinions from his opinionated mind. His writing frequency and insight to the political/foreign policy/financial measures is commendable. He is also proxy-present in Hindi blogger world via his guest posts thru Debashish.

**Best Indic (Indian Languages other than English) Blog**

I will confine myself to the Hindi language for this as that is what I do. This has to be toughest category for me as every one has become a close friend in the Hindi blogger world. Moreover the bloggers I wanted to nominate have also sponsored prizes so it becomes doubly complex. Without more words I would like to nominate following three Hindi blogs for the best Indic Blog in no particular order

<a href="http://raviratlami.blogspot.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://raviratlami.blogspot.com', 'Ravi Ratlami ka Hindi Blog aur Ghazals']);" >Ravi Ratlami ka Hindi Blog aur Ghazals</a> Ã¢â‚¬â€œ One of the most prolific writer in Hindi cyber world. He writes on socially relevant issues and all things technical related to Hindi. An accompanying gazal is his trademark and leaves people wondering how does he do it in such a short time.
