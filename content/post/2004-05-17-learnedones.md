While at work a colleague pointed that young folks who are working away from their hometowns are less likely to vote and this has more to do with the voter lists. Considering me being away over here that is impossible. But what would stop a single guy from lets say Ambala to vote in Bangalore?

If it is true isn&#8217;t it ironical&#8230;
