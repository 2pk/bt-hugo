Never knew about this feature. Apparently greater gods have been using this for a while. There is this neat feature in WP that allows you to make your URIs even nicer. Consider what is better

`http://www.pnarula.com/2004/05/15/this-is-my-first-post`

or this

`http://www.pnarula.com/2004/05/15/firstpost/`

In the first example WP is creating the post-slug automatically by using the title, I never bothered to edit it. Now after reading at <a href="http://www.libraryplanet.com/2004/05/slugs" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.libraryplanet.com/2004/05/slugs', 'LibaryPlanet ']);" >LibaryPlanet </a> I have seen the light and URIs are much nicer. Do yourself a favor and start editing those post-slugs.

_End Note:_ This is only available in WP 1.2.
