One of the reason for moving from Louisville KY to bayarea was the startup activity that happens in the valley. It is too much fun being surrounded by geeks ðŸ˜€ Andreeson whose Netscape started the IPO fever is telling on the <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2005/tc20051013_579291.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2005/tc20051013_579291.htm', 'same lines']);" >same lines</a></p> 

> There&#8217;s a critical mass of investors &#8212; way more than anywhere else, which does matter. [There are] sales people, executives, accountants, lawyers, bankers, and you&#8217;re in the flow of what&#8217;s actually going on. [Being in tech and not being in Silicon Valley] is like trying to be in the movie business not in LA or trying to be in national politics and not be in D.C. You just don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on half the time. You get outside the valley and you&#8217;re not aware of next six startups that just got funded. That actually matters.

Ofcourse now that I am here there are other reasons like great food choices for Indian Cuisine, lots of buddies from <a href="http://www.pec.ac.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pec.ac.in', 'PEC']);" >PEC</a> &#8211; the school I went to in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh', 'Chandigarh']);" >Chandigarh</a>, <a href="http://naz8.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://naz8.com', 'Naz8']);" >Naz8</a> and so on.
