I was smitten by Linux very early in my tech life. I still remember how long it took to configure X Windows on a <a href="http://www.pec.ac.in/pages/org.htm" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.pec.ac.in/pages/org.htm', 'CEL']);" >CEL</a> machine in the summer of 95. SAP also has a special initiative for <a href="http://www.sap.com/linux/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.sap.com/linux/', 'linux']);" >linux</a> It pleased me to read about German Railways migration to linux over <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,99522,00.html?source=x10" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/os/linux/story/0,10801,99522,00.html?source=x10', 'here']);" >here</a>. What got me more interested was this snippet

> The company has already shifted its vital train timetabling system from HP Non-Stop to Linux. Next, it will move various SAP systems, including sales support, from Unix to Linux. And by the end of the year, all remaining critical systems such as databases, application servers, Web servers, mail servers and network infrastructure will be running on Linux, the company said. 

Definitely some thing to watch for. Someday I want to do a detailed ROI analysis of SAP on Linux.
