So after using G+ for few days, **what are the features you like , what do you miss and what do you hate** As per me

&#8211; the best feature is ever present notification button and share box on google properties  
&#8211; unlimited photo storage for picasa or shall we say google photos  
&#8211; of course selective sharing via circles or just email  
&#8211; android app ( though it seems sparse at times)

hate or miss  
&#8211; Sparks &#8211; my friend I had high hopes from you, seems like a half baked product  
&#8211; Limited folks &#8211; that is expected, hopefully more people will adopt it  
&#8211; how to embed google docs in it
