Seems like this is the time to go to India. I had no plans to visit India 3 weeks earlier and now I am busy shopping tickets for it. Looks like <a href="http://brij.typepad.com/147/2004/06/catching_up_on_.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://brij.typepad.com/147/2004/06/catching_up_on_.html', 'people']);" >people</a> and <a href="http://prashantmullick.com/wlog/archives/2004/05/17/seatguru-rocks/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://prashantmullick.com/wlog/archives/2004/05/17/seatguru-rocks/', 'people']);" >people</a>
  
have beaten me to it. I am getting tickets in excess of $1450. Steep price boo hoo hoo  <img src="http://pnarula.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />May be someone will tell me the phone number of an angel travel agent who can procure tickets for the good ol&#8217; price of $1200.
