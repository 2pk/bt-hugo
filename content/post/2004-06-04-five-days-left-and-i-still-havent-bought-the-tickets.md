My present thoughts about _I, Me, Myself_ are &#8220;I am out of my mind&#8221; I am planning to fly the coming weekend to India. But I am still working on tickets with one of the agent over here in LA. Let&#8217;s hope I get it other wise it is a long flight thru the redlands for $1430. I guess fight till the last moment.
