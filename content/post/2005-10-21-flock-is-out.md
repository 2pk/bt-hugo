For the past few weeks/month Silicon Valley has been abuzz with the talks about Flock &#8211; a browser based on Firefox with lot of stuff added to make life easier. Before going further I would like to remind the readers a [phrase](/archives/2004/10/27/dont-you-love-om/) coined by Om of [GigaOm](http://gigaom.com) 

&#8220;Silicon Valley is a hot house where everyone smokes the same crappy weed and participates in a constant feedback loop.&#8221; 

So with that grain of salt let me say that I was happy when <a href="http://photomatt.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://photomatt.com', 'read ']);" >read </a>it on <a href="http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/10/20/flock-out-of-the-bag/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/10/20/flock-out-of-the-bag/', ' Matt&#8217;s wordpress.com']);" >Matt&#8217;s wordpress.com</a> site that Flock it out. First thing I did after downloading was to post to my Hindi weblog as this is something I have been looking for. None of the free blogging clients offer a good support for unicoded Devnagari. I was a happy puppy when flock recognized the name of my weblog correctly. Â  You can see my shiny little hindi post from weblog at <a href="http://hindi.pnarula.com/haanbhai" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hindi.pnarula.com/haanbhai', 'Haanbhai']);" >Haanbhai</a> Incidently this might be the first unicoded post from flock. Needless to say this post is also from flock. I like the ability to put technorati tags from interface itself. Will keep using Flock and let us see how it helps making my online life easier. Kudos to Flock team.

<span>Update:</span> This is from WP interface. I had some formatting challenges from the Flock interface so making the changes from WP interface. Plus how do one posts to a particular category from Flock.Â </p> 

Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/flock" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://technorati.com/tag/flock', 'flock']);" >flock</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/hindi" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://technorati.com/tag/hindi', 'hindi']);" >hindi</a>
