<img class="alignright" src="http://akshargram.com/nirantar/media/images/0605/wp_ani.gif" />I am part of the team that manages an online monthly Hindi Blogzine called <a href="http://nirantar.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://nirantar.org', 'Nirantar']);" >Nirantar</a>. The team is quite geographically dispersed through out the globe joined by the common thread of love for Hindi. Every one has their personal weblogs in Hindi and also contributes to various other <a href="http://www.myjavaserver.com/~hindi/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.myjavaserver.com/~hindi/', 'initiatives']);" >initiatives</a>. We launched the magazine in March 2005. For the past two months everyone has been working very hard on the June issue which is going to be WordPress special. Stay tuned to read some great articles on WordPress.
