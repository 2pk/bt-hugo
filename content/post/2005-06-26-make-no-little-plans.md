Here is an excerpt

> This quote (via Atanu) by Daniel Burnham, Chicago architect, sums up what I think should be your philosophy for life. â€œMake no little plans. They have no magic to stir men&#8217;s blood and probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty. Think big.&#8221;

> When you are ready to make your mark in the world, keep these words in mind. Too often, we are happy with the mundane, the ordinary. All around, we see mediocrity. People are happy being good. Good is the enemy of Great. **We get into a groove, a comfort zone, and stay there. Donâ€™t. We live only once. Dream big.** We are where we are today only because a few in our past dared to think different and envision a world that could be.
