Few weeks back I attended <a href="http://futuresalon.org" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://futuresalon.org', 'Future Salon']);" >Future Salon</a> for the first time. It was by none other than <a href="http://pnarula.com/archives/2004/11/09/doug-engelbart-nov-19-future-salon/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnarula.com/archives/2004/11/09/doug-engelbart-nov-19-future-salon/', 'Doug Engelbart']);" >Doug Engelbart</a> and the topic was Collective IQ. I have to admit my mind has a bent for the collective word. Having been a past fan of Ayn Rand, collective word ring some negative bells in my mind. Essentially that every thing great comes from works of few genius beings. So I was more than anxious to hear great mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thoughts. Without surprise someone asked the same question during the talk. Discussion among the audience led to the idea Ã¢â‚¬â€œ yes great ideas come from great minds but they always stand on the shoulders of giants. Ah.. simple thought but epiphany for me ðŸ˜€ <!--more-->

DougÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s talk was different from my biases on more oriented towards information mining. He talked about we have so much information on the internet Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thousands of conversations going on, threaded discussions, hundreds of meeting documents among organizations, documents containing arguments and counter arguments etc. considering this can there be a system which can draw inference on some thing out of this information. In a simple scenario if 10 participants to a essay writing submitted their essays to this system can this system draw a conclusion out of these essays. Now scale this to hundreds of thousands of documents.
