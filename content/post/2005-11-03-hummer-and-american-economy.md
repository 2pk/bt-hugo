Tim talks about the <a href="http://themessthatgreenspanmade.blogspot.com/2005/11/hummer-overfloweth.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://themessthatgreenspanmade.blogspot.com/2005/11/hummer-overfloweth.html', 'growing inventory of Hummers']);" >growing inventory of Hummers</a> at the local dealer in sunny and beautiful San Diego(the epicenter of Housing Bubble). He even clicked few photographs from the so called undisclosed location

What I liked about the post was that it shows the power of blogging or an excellent piece of <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/19/43OPstrategic_1.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/10/19/43OPstrategic_1.html', 'citizen journalism']);"  title="Making a routine of citizen journalism">citizen journalism</a> as Dan Gilmore of <a href="http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://bayosphere.com/blog/dangillmor', 'BayOSphere']);" >BayOSphere</a> calls it. Tim ends the post with a thoughtful metaphor 

> The reason that the story of rapidly rising Hummer inventory is so interesting and so amusing, is that America&#8217;s most ostentatious Sport Utility Vehicle, ** _the Hummer SUV, is a metaphor for America_** in the world today &#8211; overweight, overpriced, inefficient, and unloved.
