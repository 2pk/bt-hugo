> &#8220;Law firms competed with one another to file the largest number of foreclosures on behalf of lenders – and were rewarded for their work with bonuses. These and other companies that handled the preparation of documents were paid for volume, so they processed as many as they could _en masse,_ leaving little time to read the paperwork and catch errors.&#8221;

I guess this was the flaw Greenspan admitted. I understand incentives matter. So if the incentives are stacked like this &#8211; is the only way actors will behave? Is regulation the only way out?
