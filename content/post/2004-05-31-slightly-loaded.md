Finally I did some work on the remaining todo items for Beta Thoughts

**Branding**
  
I am pleased with my work on the logo. It is a picture of digit nine in binary i.e. 1001. It is said that 9 is the most powerful digit . Will do some more research on it later. If someone has some link on it please leave a comment. 

<div class="floatright">
  <img src="http://pnarula.com/images/bt/logo.gif" width="200" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

Also notice the same logo in address bar. I need to work on the header image as jpeg is totally messed after being subjected to many saves.

**Install with a different directory**
  
Pretty simple just had to follow the guide over <a href="http://wordpress.org/docs/installation/different-address/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/docs/installation/different-address/', 'here']);" >here</a>.

**SAP Category and its separate page**
  
Being a SAP Netweaver consultant I wanted to write about it but didn&#8217;t wanted to put it on the main page. Just had to follow this <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/5/5687" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/support/5/5687', 'message']);" >message</a> on forums. Now the SAP categories has its own sideblog at <a href="http://pnarula.com/sap" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnarula.com/sap', 'http://pnarula.com/sap']);" >http://pnarula.com/sap</a>

TODO: Still thinking about should I go with Matt&#8217;s <a href="http://photomatt.net/archives/2004/05/19/asides/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://photomatt.net/archives/2004/05/19/asides/', 'asides']);" >asides</a> or RebelPixel&#8217;s <a href="http://rebelpixel.com/projects/wp-recent-links/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rebelpixel.com/projects/wp-recent-links/', 'Recent-Links']);" >Recent-Links</a>. Any suggestions?
