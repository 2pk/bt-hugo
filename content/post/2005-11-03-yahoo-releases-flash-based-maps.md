Long time readers of Beta Thoughts would know my love for Maps. May be this comes from the time I spent in creating GIS for Chandigarh while still at <a href="http://pec.ac.in" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pec.ac.in', 'college']);" >college</a>. I was so happy when Google released its map offering with cool AJAX features. I even did a little [screencast](/200502/google-maps/) using [Wink](http://www.debugmode.com/wink/).

Today Yahoo released the Beta version of its maps application based on flash and I love it. Yahoo maps API is so easy that it takes less than few minutes to comeup with your stuff. Based up on their Javascript API I created a flash based map of the center of desi land i.e. Lawrence and El Camino cross section with a overlay of &#8220;Indian Food&#8221; You can see my favorite grocery shop in the map along with 10 other points.</p>

So far it is only US based (I can see smoke coming out of <a href="http://ngoel.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://ngoel.com', 'Niks']);" >Niks</a> ears) Hopefully they will cover the rest of world along with a little island somewhere in Asia-Pacific.</p>
