Just read &#8220;The new road to riches&#8221; by Om Malik by following the plug from his blog <a href="http://www.gigaom.com/2004/10/business_20_un.php" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.gigaom.com/2004/10/business_20_un.php', 'post']);" >post</a>. Thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Fires up the thought engine which asks me &#8220;Dude what you been doing..&#8221; The next OddPost might be around the corner ðŸ˜€

On a separate note, the photograph that accompanies the story is quite suitable and reminds me of &#8220;Dil Chahata Hai&#8221; the hindi movie ðŸ˜€
