> if this culture of participation was seemingly help build businesses on our collective backs. So if we tag, bookmark or share, and help **del.icio.us** or **Technorati** or **Yahoo** become better commercial entities, **arenâ€™t we seemingly commoditizing our most valuable asset &#8211; time.** We become the outsourced workforce, the collective, though it is still unclear what is the pay-off. While we may (or may not) gain something from the collective efforts, the odds are whatever â€œthe collective effortsâ€ are, they are going to boost the economic value of those entities. Will they share in their upside? Not likely!

Coming to Om&#8217;s point of being the outsourced workforce &#8211; there has to be something for this to work. So far del.icio.us, technorati have been hugely successful. Any successful transaction involves give and take. If I create a link pointing to AJAX, there are thousands other links created by the community in the same area for me to see. Naturally I got the benefit of that collective work. So yes _1 Person vs. del.icio.us_ is definitely in favor of the site but _n Persons vs. del.icio.us_ definitely tilts the scale towards an individual.

I have often wondered about this in regards to <a href="http://akshargram.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://akshargram.com', 'Akshargram']);" >Akshargram</a> &#8211; the online hindi bloggers community website I have the honor to host. It is sort of a virtual meeting place where hindi blogger&#8217;s ruminate on various things like geeks talk about technology on Slashdot, Culture of participation thouhts of Om are true about akshargram too. Without the community akshargram would have died a silent death. So if participants spend time inÂ  writing posts to Akshargram, do they lose or gain any thing. In my opinion I think it works both ways.
