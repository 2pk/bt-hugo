It finally dawned upon me today that a photoblog is not the same as photo gallery. I have been confused between these two. For example I wanted something which would have the capabilites of both. A photoblog is where a photographer displays his best pics with commentry along each photograph. Nilesh&#8217;s <a href="http://shutterbug.nu" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://shutterbug.nu', 'Shutterbug']);" >Shutterbug</a> and <a href="http://prashantmullick.com/plog" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://prashantmullick.com/plog', 'Prashant&#8217;s Photoblog']);" >Prashant&#8217;s Photoblog</a> is along the same line. While a gallery is what lazy people like me who are not photographers but still click any way and haul them at a place on the web. Galleries is also a nice way to share photographs among kith and kin.
