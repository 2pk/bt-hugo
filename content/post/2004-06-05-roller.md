As I said <a href="http://pnarula.com/archives/2004/05/18/javaphp/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://pnarula.com/archives/2004/05/18/javaphp/', 'earlier ']);" >earlier </a> for the corporate world Roller type java blogs make a lot more sense. Sun&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.sun.com/roller/', 'decision ']);" >decision </a> to use Roller also cemented these thoughts. Finally I installed Roller 0.9.8 at my present client and boy that was a breeze of an install. While it can not be compared to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/docs/installation/5-minute/" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://wordpress.org/docs/installation/5-minute/', '5-minute install']);" >5-minute install</a> of WordPress but for a multi-user blogging application deployed on a solid J2EE based scalable architecture it is great. It took me about 40-55 minutes to install excluding the download time for various components. Install was in a Windows environment. The only place where I stopped to think was <a href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=InstallationGuide#ref-InstallationGuide-6" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.rollerweblogger.org/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=InstallationGuide#ref-InstallationGuide-6', 'Search Engine index']);" >Search Engine index</a> settings. I had to make Tomcat service run as a named user account instead of the default LocalSystem Account.Overall I am quite happy.
