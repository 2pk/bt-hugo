Atanu&#8217;s post over at Deeshaa about India Development are always very pertinent. In his latest post on _**leapfrogging**_India into a developed nation and his related posts elsewhere on Deeshaa he brings up excellent points. Gist of it is that you don&#8217;t go from an agricultural econmoy to services economy, you have to go thru the industrial/manufacturing stage. And for a large economies like India most of the stuff/products should be consumed domestically. It is the last point that got me interested in these posts by Atanu. I was still in college so it must be at least 7-8 years old news. A couple of professors from Berkeley or Stanford were visiting Banglore and they echoed the same things that for Banglore to be the _Real Silicon Valley_ most of the services generated by it should be consumed in the domestic market.

Any way here are the links to Atanu&#8217;s posts
