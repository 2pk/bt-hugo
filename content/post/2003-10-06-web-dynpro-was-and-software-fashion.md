A couple of weeks ago I downloaded WebAS 6.4 Beta from <a href="http://sdn.sap.com" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://sdn.sap.com', 'SDN']);" >SDN</a> and have been&nbsp;making crude stabs at writng MDA web apps with it. It touts a new web app tool called WebDynPro which seems a decent tool for wrting business apps. Now coming to <a href="http://www.softwarereality.com/soapbox/softwarefashion.jsp" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.softwarereality.com/soapbox/softwarefashion.jsp', 'Software Fashion']);" >Software Fashion</a> context. I read at software reality how there are fashions in the software industry. It made me think that is this (webdynpro) also a fashion or is this in for the long run? I hope it is in for a long term.
