While reading the book What I talk about when i talk about running, I came across this para about Talent vs Persistent hard work. This got to be the best lines I read this week

> I think this viewpoint applies as well to the job of the novelist. Writers who are blessed with inborn talent can freely write novels no matter what they doâ€”or don&#8217;t do. Like water from a natural spring, the sentences just well up, and with little or no effort these writers can complete a work. Occasionally you&#8217;ll find someone like that, but, unfortunately, that category wouldn&#8217;t include me. I haven&#8217;t spotted any springs nearby. I have to pound the rock with a chisel and dig out a deep hole before I can locate the source of creativity. To write a novel I have to drive myself hard physically and use a lot of time and effort. Every time I begin a new novel, I have to dredge out another new, deep hole. But as I&#8217;ve sustained this kind of life over many years, I&#8217;ve become quite efficient, both technically and physically, at opening a hole in the hard rock and locating a new water vein. So as soon as I notice one water source drying up, I can move on right away to another. If people who rely on a natural spring of talent suddenly find they&#8217;ve exhausted their only source, they&#8217;re in trouble.
