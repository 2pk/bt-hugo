When thinking about giants of computing one easily forgets that they were young once, this tidbit from What the Dormouse Said about Doug Engelbart is very interesting. His manager is complaining about him to his manager

"Jerry, I know you well enough. I have two things to say, and it will only take sixty seconds point number one is that you have to choose.you either have to risk it on this guy our you have to fire him the second thing I have to say its that this the brightest guy I have ever worked with."
