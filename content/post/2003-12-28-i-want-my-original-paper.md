Seems like this is the age of aggregators. Be it news aggregator sites like Sulekha.com for the average Indian dude, or Slashdot for run of the mill IT guy. To top them all we have RSS feeds for everything so Feeddemons are busy collecting news for folks. Though I shouldn&#8217;t be complaining as these sites and software programs do save a lot of time with all that information bloating in every nook and corner. Still somewhere I have the vague longing for my innocent looking Times of India or New York Times when I would see them in entirety. And not read the headlines.
